<h2>What is the Planarian Anatomy Gene Expression (PAGE) Database?</h2>
<p><h3>PAGE is a database of transcript/gene expression assigned to anatomical structures from published papers from between January 2005 and October 2019. </h3></p>
<br>
<h2>How is PAGE built?</h2>
<p>
<h3>PAGE is the integration of the <a href="/anatomyontology">Planarian Anatomy Ontology</a> (PLANA Ontology) and curated expression data from these publications.</h3></p>
<p><h3>To construct the PLANA Ontology all anatomical terms used in these papers where cataloged and organized into unique terms and synonyms. These curated terms were compiled into an ontology of related terms, PLANA Ontology. An example of terms organized and related:
<ul style="position: relative;left: 20px">
<li> 'eye' is contained in 'head'</li>
<li>'photoreceptor neuron' is part of 'eye'</li>
<li>therefore with ontological reasoning, 'photoreceptor neuron' is also contained in 'head'</li>
</ul>
</h3></p>

<h2>How to use PAGE?</h2>
<p><h3>
This hierarchical ontological organization lends itself to enabling powerful searches that use inference. To make good use of the ontology’s searchability and aggregate expression information for the community, all expression information in the reviewed manuscripts was manually recorded. The PLANA Ontology and the curated expression data were interleaved to make the PAGE database. To use the database one can search by anatomical term, by transcript, or by individual publication:
<ul  style="position: relative;left: 20px">
<li><a href="/search/page/term">PAGE Term Search</a>: Search for transcripts expressed in an anatomical term</li>
<li><a href="/search/page/transcript">PAGE Transcript Search</a>: Search for all anatomical terms where a specific transcript is expressed</li>
<li><a href="/search/page/publication">PAGE Publication Search</a>: Search for all the transcripts found in a publication and the anatomical terms in which these transcripts are expressed</li>
</ul>
